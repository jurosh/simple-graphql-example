# Simple GraphQL server implementations

*WARNING: This example might be slightly out of date, please check official docs for used libraries*



GraphQL server using **Express** & **Apollo** & **Prisma**.

_Please not that this repo contains only basic implementations, GraphQL can be much more powerfull._

If you want simply generate backend based on Models only, you can use great [GraphCool service](https://www.graph.cool/).
There is also interesting [code generator](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator) project.

Another cool project from Graphcool is [**Prisma**](https://github.com/graphcool/prisma).
Prisma can easily generate ready to run GraphQL backend and can be hosted myself or in Prisma cloud.

To setup robust server you can also use [**Apollo** server](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/).
It's great and stable solution.

To learn more about GraphQL visit [GraphQL official website](http://graphql.org/learn/).
